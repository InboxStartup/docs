# Fund Raising

At an early stage, almost all inbound investment proposals are noise or may be even scams. Be careful, don't waste your time.

Remember that fund-raising is a high-touch interaction. Most investors would reply to your generic mail-merge. Research, target, get warm intros or write awesome cold emails.
