## Sebastianism

[Sebastianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastianism) is a Portuguese messianic myth, based on the belief that King Sebastian of Portugal, who disappeared in the battle of Alcácer Quibir, would reappear and return to Portugal at some point in the future. The belief gained momentum after an interpretation by priest António Vieira of Daniel 2 and the Book of Revelation that foreshadowed a Portuguese Fifth Empire.

In a Startup, the founders believed that a celebrity-ish engineer or designer hire will turn the tide of the Startup. No, it won't. It will have to be you.
