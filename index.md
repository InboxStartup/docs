# Start

![Helping Startups during the chaotic zero stage.](/assets/img/hero-1.jpg "Start")

So, you have decided to Startup. Welcome, but it isn't going to be easy. Starting and running a Startup is like eating broken glasses; after a while, you begin to like the taste of your blood.

Remember, in the beginning, you have to do things - everything.

- Who's going to write the first code or use a no-code tool to do it -- you.
- Who's going to make the coffee/tea -- you.
- Who is going to clean that toilet -- bloody you.

We will be _unbiased_ and won’t try to _“guide”_ you in your Startup journey. We will try our possible ways to link to resources and means to navigate through the phases from when you have an idea to an operational Startup.

The resources, tools, and utilities are targeted at Startups from the idea to the seed stage, with an aim to raise venture funding. We believe that once you hit your priced round, such as a Series-A and beyond, you will have the resources to take care of your needs.

> “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.” -- Steve Jobs

## FAQ

- Except for the topics (folders), nothing is organized. It is left to you to figure out and pick the best that fits you and leave the ones that do not. Go around and jump in to the ones that makes sense to you right there.
