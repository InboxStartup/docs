# Start

> Helping Startups during the chaotic zero stage.

So, you have decided to Startup. Welcome, but it ain't gonna be easy. Starting and running a Startup is like eating broken glasses, after a while, you begin to like the taste of your own blood.

## Startups

The resources, tools, and utilities are targeted at Startups from an Idea stage to about Seed-Stage funds. We believe that once you hit your priced-round (Series-A), you would have your resources to take care of your needs.
