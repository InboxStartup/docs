Send the deck to them afterwards, thanking them for their time.","Consider font size, line spacing, line length at first.","Context. Showing a graph with error rates? Great! But do include the normal rates in the same graph for comparison.","Data points. Chances are you have mentioned some piece of data somewhere. That is good. Not all is lost. Just make clear what the units are. Something costs 1 million? Is that Euros or Dollars? Almost no costs I encounter are static, in other words they are likely better expressed as a rate of costs: “This option will cost 1 million dollars per year, starting April 1st”. Secondly, if you have a lot riding on the data point (and why include it if you do not?) then make sure to include an attribution or source the data point. The more authoritative you can make this, the better.","Do not underline at all.","Do not use bold and italics together.","Ensure your slide has a take-away. The slide presents thoughts, data, or whatever; too often the conclusion or the action point of it is left to the reader or as voice over. Do not do this; spell out the take-away for your audience. They did not sign up for a Sherlock Holmes role-play.","Executive Summary. Have one. No, have two: the slide after your title slide should be your executive summary. Then run through your story line and bookend again with the executive summary. This should be pixel for pixel the same content as the one in the beginning. Your executive summary is not allowed to introduce anything new; no new data, concepts or conclusions.","Font sizes. You are still creating a presentation, so rule #2 still applies.","Graphs. I feel this requires its own article. In fact entire books have been written on the topic. Instead, I will attempt to quickly run down the top points","Homework. Do not try to convince your audience that you have done all your homework before presenting the results. This is not your main message, and it will distract. When I see this happen it often shows up as #11 “Wall of text”. If you are that person, ask yourself why the audience would assume you did not do your homework. You are likely operating under baseless assumptions.","Minimum font size 24pt. Yes, not all the words in your mind will fit on that one page. Yes, that constraint will actually help you create a clearer narrative. If it does not fit, you are not done clarifying your messaging concisely.","No Builds. No presentation needs builds (exposing one bullet point of a list at a time), animations or transitions; no exceptions. In business this will invariably go wrong. Your audience will ask to go back a slide or two, you end up half way in a build, or worse, with an empty slide. None of this is needed.","No numbers until you are done talking. As soon as you put up a set of numbers or a graph the audience will think, analyse and stop paying attention. That is your best case scenario. Worst case, someone will interrupt you with a question that potentially disrupts the flow. So only show these after you are done presenting your main point.","No Pie charts. Invariably a time series chart will lead to better comparisons of the data and will give the audience a sense of temporal change that pie charts lack.","Slide numbers. Each slide should have one. Not having one on random slides is telling me you fumbled the slides together. It makes it hard for me to take notes, or to speed up asking questions at the end. Do not do this to your audience. Cheap to fix.","Stick with your organization’s template. The challenge when you deviate from the default template is that it will become cute, a time sink or a distraction for the reader. So stick with the default. Don’t like the default? Then create a new one as a separate activity.","Structure. Stories can be told in many different ways. One way that works well in most situations is to divide the story arc up in Situation, Complication and Solution. Leaving one of these three components out will seriously hamper your ability to convince your audience, just like it is hard to ascend a staircase with stairs missing. Yes, this advice is coming from Professional Career PowerPoint Wielders: take it. That link lays out the structure, and has actual examples to get you going.","The question mark is underused, the exclamation point overused.","Titles. Titles for the individual slides or graphs should be the conclusion. Not only will this save your audience from expanding the mental energy, it allows you to select the conclusion you need if there is more than one available. So instead of “tire wear vs miles driven” it should say “tire wear increases with miles driven”.","Treat headings as the structure of your argument, not your document.","Typography. Grok the basics of typography. Think of this as a set of battle tested heuristics that do not require you to understand, but just apply. I have found that Practical Typography is a fantastic resource for this. A couple of quick relevant points are:","Use fewer words. Rule number 2 is trying to help you here. But for each iteration I set myself the goal of removing half the words. This is hard, as I feel I need to leave out important details and context. There is a place for details and context, but the most important is the actual message you want to get across.","Wall of text. Do not ever present a slide while starting off with “Well, I’m not going to read all this out to you, but…”. You have lost half the audience because they are reading your wall of text. You lost the other half because you are being disrespectful to them. So simply do not include any wall of text. Rule #2 is here to help you with that."]}],[{"i":"your-product-demo-sucks-because-its-focused-on-your-product","l":"Your Product Demo Sucks Because it’s Focused on Your Product","p":["“Be upfront with the people you're talking to.

They have to be perfect for the audience.","Here is a summarized, shortened, key highlights of the article. Read, and re-read the original article -- Your Product Demo Sucks Because it’s Focused on Your Product.","Instead of memorizing every nuance of your product, prep time is much better spent thinking up all the questions you want to ask your customers, and the questions you believe you'll get from them. If you can come up with answers to all of these questions, you'll go into your demo meeting with holistic, agile knowledge. You'll be able to hop from one part of the product to another with ease, and adapt to the unexpected. Note that these questions need to be for your audience too — you want to build a list that will help you gather as much information about them upfront as possible.","It's very effective to use this same structure for a product demo. You want your audience to envision, and if possible, experience what life with your service or product will be like.","Kick off your demo with the outcome that everyone in the room wants. Make it clear how much better their lives and jobs could be if they used your product. Then pull back and explain why.","Mirror the energy in the room, the words they use, how they talk about their product and your product. You'll understand each other that much faster.","One of the easiest and biggest mistakes he sees is that companies don’t effectively craft their demo to fit their specific audience — i.e. they don’t distill their dozens of features and selling points into the few that will really resonate with this particular investor, prospect, or even prospective employee.","Start macro so that you don't go over anyone's head and you frame your argument as simply as possible. Then go micro into the areas that align with your audience's specific interests.","This is from an awesome article discussiing the gotchas of Robert Falcone, Director of Solutions Engineering, Monetate.","Unless you make yourself clear and relevant, customers will go with whatever company or competitor shows off the shiniest new object.","You don't want a rock solid, set-in-stone plan.

And even if your product is absolutely unique, your audience might have other things to spend their money on. In this section, you’ll talk about your competitors and figure out what they’re doing and what your advantage is.","For a formal analysis, you’ll want to look at a few different types of competition:","Direct competitors. Direct competitors are companies that do the same thing you do, for the same target audience, in the same way. For many business owners, this is likely who you think of when you think of the competition. They’re in the same business, sell similar or identical products, operate where you do, and can seem interchangeable to your customers. Indirect competitors. Indirect competitors share some but not all of the characteristics of your business. They may target the same customers as you, with the same product, but operate in a different geographic area. Or they may have the same customers and operate in the same location but sell a slightly different product.","Tertiary or peripheral competitors. These are companies that don’t sell the same product or service as you, but otherwise compete for your target audience’s money. Remember that most customers have a limited discretionary budget. If they spend it elsewhere, even if it’s not on products similar to yours, it’s still less money that they have to spend on your products or services.","Potential competitors. These businesses don’t exist yet, but they could change the way your industry operates. A great example is how Uber began competing with taxi companies. It was an entirely new business model that worked in a radically new way, and it provided a service that replaced some of the need for taxis.","Narrowing down your direct competitors is a little bit more challenging but not much more if you think strategically. A good rule is to think in groups of four: biggest, best, closest, and catching up.","Biggest is the easiest one to figure out. Who is the market leader or the biggest competitor you have? Best is more subjective. Who do you think is the best, coolest, most talked about, or most envied of your competitors? Closest is typically the second easiest to figure out. Which of your competitors do you feel is the closest in terms of size, price, customers, etc.? Catching up is smaller than you but gaining ground. Which of your smaller competitors is closest to catching up with you?

And when (not if) the job becomes unnecessary, so will your position."]}],[{"i":"strategy-and-tactics-marketing","l":"Strategy and Tactics, Marketing","p":["The strategy and tactics part of your marketing plan is the meat of what you’ll be doing. It’s also where a lot of marketing plan writers make mistakes by forgetting that strategy and tactics are two different things. (We’ll cover this in more detail later.)","A complete marketing strategy consists of four parts:","Marketing positioning: an explanation of your company’s differentiators and competitive advantages and why they matter","Major marketing campaigns: any large or long-term initiatives you plan to run over the period covered by your marketing plan","Marketing tactics: an outline covering the specific activities you plan on performing to meet your marketing goals","Marketing calendar: dates for any marketing initiatives or campaigns you plan to run, along with any other dates you feel may be important (e.g., new store openings, new product launches, etc.)"]}],[{"l":"Management Principles","p":["Always follow through.","Always hire people better and smarter than yourself and give them the means to excel.","Always make sure to communicate the purpose of a proposed meeting beforehand — don’t leave people guessing why a meeting is suddenly being called.","Always set clear boundaries over who has final decision-making authority for key areas so expectations are clear. (Feedback and open dialogue aren’t in opposition to final decision-making authority for most critical path issues.)","Always show up. Consistency is key.","Crunch time should be an exception rather than a normal mode of operation.","Don’t argue with a business partner or client in front of employees/contractors — or anyone else for that matter.","For people who make/own/oversee software development: Believe your engineers when they give you an honest assessment of what can be done by a certain time.","If you are becoming a bottleneck, remove yourself from the equation to clear pathways.","If you are only hiring from within your existing social circles, you are not doing enough to promote diversity and inclusion at all levels.","In terms of hiring, be willing to give people who may not seem like a perfect fit a chance. Don’t try to put people in categories too soon.","It’s much easier for a team to have to suddenly pivot in terms of focus or priorities if the rationale is clear to all involved and good structures for regular and consistent communication are in place.","Listening > Talking","Margaret Wallace, co-founder of Playmatics wrote a beautiful article, on Management Principles.","Never ask anyone who works with you to do something that you yourself would not consider doing (unless they really want to and it’s ethical).","Never communicate bad news in an email if at all possible.","Never ever ever disparage another employee, contractor or associate in front of another employee, contractor or associate — and don’t really do it at all.","Radical candor should not be seen as a threat — or only afforded to certain people within the organization.","Respect the time of others.","Sometimes managers have to step in if they see something that is veering off-course. However, micro-management for the sake of micro-management doesn’t set up an environment for success.","Trust your team’s ability to come up with and recommend solutions to challenges or processes. Whenever I’m presented with a problem by a team member, my first question is to ask the team member what they think the best course of action is to rectify/improve."]}],[{"l":"Presentation Rules","p":["This is inspired from a well article that Jilles Oldenbeuving posted on Jun 5, 2020 -- Presentation Rules.","I really like the highlights from the article that most failure stems from lack of communication. Presentations, either as verb or noun, are a substantial part of communications in a business.","Here is a reproduction of the rules, from the article, verbatim."]},{"l":"Rules","p":["All axis are labeled. What do they represent, and include a unit.","Artifacts. Some people insist on sending the slides ahead of time. I think that depends on the situation. However, I insist on sending the slides after the presentation. Do not waste time by forcing your audience to ask for a copy of the slides, take half correct notes or worse, interrupt your presentation over Zoom with camera sound as they are taking screenshots. Send the deck to them afterwards, thanking them for their time.","Consider font size, line spacing, line length at first.","Context. Showing a graph with error rates? Great! But do include the normal rates in the same graph for comparison.","Data points. Chances are you have mentioned some piece of data somewhere. That is good. Not all is lost. Just make clear what the units are. Something costs 1 million? Is that Euros or Dollars? Almost no costs I encounter are static, in other words they are likely better expressed as a rate of costs: “This option will cost 1 million dollars per year, starting April 1st”. Secondly, if you have a lot riding on the data point (and why include it if you do not?) then make sure to include an attribution or source the data point. The more authoritative you can make this, the better.","Do not underline at all.","Do not use bold and italics together.","Ensure your slide has a take-away. The slide presents thoughts, data, or whatever; too often the conclusion or the action point of it is left to the reader or as voice over. Do not do this; spell out the take-away for your audience. They did not sign up for a Sherlock Holmes role-play.","Executive Summary. Have one. No, have two: the slide after your title slide should be your executive summary. Then run through your story line and bookend again with the executive summary. This should be pixel for pixel the same content as the one in the beginning. Your executive summary is not allowed to introduce anything new; no new data, concepts or conclusions.","Font sizes. You are still creating a presentation, so rule #2 still applies.","Graphs. I feel this requires its own article. In fact entire books have been written on the topic. Instead, I will attempt to quickly run down the top points","Homework. Do not try to convince your audience that you have done all your homework before presenting the results. This is not your main message, and it will distract. When I see this happen it often shows up as #11 “Wall of text”. If you are that person, ask yourself why the audience would assume you did not do your homework. You are likely operating under baseless assumptions.","Minimum font size 24pt. Yes, not all the words in your mind will fit on that one page. Yes, that constraint will actually help you create a clearer narrative. If it does not fit, you are not done clarifying your messaging concisely.","No Builds. No presentation needs builds (exposing one bullet point of a list at a time), animations or transitions; no exceptions. In business this will invariably go wrong. Your audience will ask to go back a slide or two, you end up half way in a build, or worse, with an empty slide. None of this is needed.","No numbers until you are done talking. As soon as you put up a set of numbers or a graph the audience will think, analyse and stop paying attention. That is your best case scenario. Worst case, someone will interrupt you with a question that potentially disrupts the flow. So only show these after you are done presenting your main point.","No Pie charts. Invariably a time series chart will lead to better comparisons of the data and will give the audience a sense of temporal change that pie charts lack.","Slide numbers. Each slide should have one. Not having one on random slides is telling me you fumbled the slides together. It makes it hard for me to take notes, or to speed up asking questions at the end. Do not do this to your audience. Cheap to fix.","Stick with your organization’s template. The challenge when you deviate from the default template is that it will become cute, a time sink or a distraction for the reader. So stick with the default. Don’t like the default? Then create a new one as a separate activity.","Structure. Stories can be told in many different ways. One way that works well in most situations is to divide the story arc up in Situation, Complication and Solution. Leaving one of these three components out will seriously hamper your ability to convince your audience, just like it is hard to ascend a staircase with stairs missing. Yes, this advice is coming from Professional Career PowerPoint Wielders: take it. That link lays out the structure, and has actual examples to get you going.","The question mark is underused, the exclamation point overused.","Titles. Titles for the individual slides or graphs should be the conclusion. Not only will this save your audience from expanding the mental energy, it allows you to select the conclusion you need if there is more than one available. So instead of “tire wear vs miles driven” it should say “tire wear increases with miles driven”.","Treat headings as the structure of your argument, not your document.","Typography. Grok the basics of typography. Think of this as a set of battle tested heuristics that do not require you to understand, but just apply. I have found that Practical Typography is a fantastic resource for this. A couple of quick relevant points are:","Use fewer words. Rule number 2 is trying to help you here. But for each iteration I set myself the goal of removing half the words. This is hard, as I feel I need to leave out important details and context. There is a place for details and context, but the most important is the actual message you want to get across.","Wall of text. Do not ever present a slide while starting off with “Well, I’m not going to read all this out to you, but…”. You have lost half the audience because they are reading your wall of text. You lost the other half because you are being disrespectful to them. So simply do not include any wall of text. Rule #2 is here to help you with that."]}],[{"l":"Product Vision","p":["(Just as the value of a prototype isn't the prototype, but in the prototyping and all of the learning that comes from it).","And so that's why timeline roadmaps are causing product teams to fail, and why the switch to lean, discovery-centric roadmapping processes is so important.","At the end of the day, the value isn't in the 'roadmap' itself. It's in the process of roadmapping, which is inherently a discovery process.","Combine the vision, your objectives, and your time horizons to articulate your product strategy in a new way. Ditch the timeline roadmap and embrace the lean product roadmap.","Create 3 Columns and separate them as (i) Current (ii) Near Term, and (iii) Future.","For (Target Customer) Who (statemet of need or opportunity) The (Product Name) is a (Product category) That (key benefit, reason to buy) Unlike (primary competetive alternative) Our Product (statement of primary differentiation)","Having a timeline roadmap also forces you to assume that nothing else is going to come in and disrupt your plans. No new competitors, no changes in the market, no need to change your plans.","Instead;","It makes sense: You've got greater visibility on the things right in front of you, and less on the things further away. Each column represents a change in visibility and flexibility in your roadmap.","It's meant to change as you learn more, and a lean roadmap format gives you that flexibility.","One assumption you're making when you make a timeline roadmap is that you know how long each feature is going to take.","Remember, your roadmap is not meant to be a perfect plan of everything you're doing.","Start with a Product Vision","Switch out your timeline for time horizons.","The old school way of Product Roadmapping, the timeline format, is no longer valid. A timeline roadmap, by its very format, means that you are giving a due date and duration to every thing you're putting on that roadmap. That's a whole lot of assumptions you're making there.","Think outcomes, not output","This might be easy in the short term when you've got clarity from your developers on delivery plans, but it gets harder and harder the further out you plan.","User Growth, Engagement, Revenue, Reduce Churn, User Experience, Infrastructure.","Your roadmap is a prototype for your product strategy.","Your roadmap should be tracked to company-level objectives, not a pile of features for features' sake.
