# Business Ideas

How to come up with a great business idea.

## Problem Definition

Customer Type: Who are the possible customers we could help? Be as specific as possible about segments.
Problem: What job are they trying to get done? e.g finding sales leads or tracking competitors.
Current Solution: How are they solving the problem today?
What pain do they have: Whatâ€™s painful about the current solution? Is it urgent, expensive, mandatory, or frequent?

## Problem Assessment

Do we want to play in this market?
Which customer segments are growing? How fast?
Is the market size at least $50M/year?
What existing players already solve this problem? How are we different?
What existing players could easily solve this problem? Would we have moats?

## Is there a business model that makes sense?

What would the business model be?
What would the price point be?
How many customers do we need to get to $1M/year?

## Can we validate this easily?

Who could we sell this to in 24hr if we had a product?

## Can we build this easily?

Can we deliver a low-cost (e.g no-code or manual) product in 1 week?
Can we deliver an MVP self-service solution in 3 months and $100K?

## Can we acquire customers easily?

Is this self-service (no onboarding, integrations or customer success)?
Can we acquire customers without salespeople?
Is the customer different to the buyer? Can we access them?
Fill out all of these questions in a Notion template or similar. If you can identify all the above points and believe you can sell your product within 24 hours then you may be onto a winner.
