# Market

> Marketing is the process of getting people interested in the goods and services being sold.

Own your marketing channels, contents, identities; use tools as a means to meet your marketing needs.

Do not rely on Press but treat as just another channel for the occassional burst. Make an 'intrinsically viral' - people should be happy sharing it to their friends.

Growth never last forever, keep tweaking and tuning growth, always.

- Define a larger cause. Start by explaining the cause. e.g. "need to increase farm yields"
- Articulate the problem better than anyone else
- attack the status quo
- define a category. this category is the solution.
- build the right team
- use "grass roots" customer testimoney
- release news in lightning strikes, not dribs and dreabs
- organize events to focus attention
- nurture your community
- pick noble fights
- strive for a large tent
- work with press and inluencers in the right way
- stay grounded
- don't clown yourself. back up your claims and avoid aggrandizing and arrogant language.
