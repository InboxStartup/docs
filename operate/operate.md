# Operate

Once, I found this nugget of equating business roles with the pieces of Chess.

| Chess  | Business        |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| King   | Execution        |
| Queen  | Marketing        |
| Bishop | Customer Service |
| Knight | Product          |
| Rook   | People           |
| Pawns  | Ideas            |
