# Start

> Helping Startups during the chaotic zero stage.

So, you have decided to Startup. Welcome, but it ain't gonna be easy. Starting and running a Startup is like eating broken glasses, after a while, you begin to like the taste of your own blood.

Remember, in the beginning, you have to do things - everything.

- Who's going to write the first code or use a no-code tool to do it -- you.
- Who's going to make the coffee/tea -- you.
- Who is going to clean that toilet -- bloody you.

The resources, tools, and utilities are targeted at Startups from an idea to seed stage. We believe that once you hit your priced-round, such as a Series-A and beyond, you would have your resources to take care of your needs.
